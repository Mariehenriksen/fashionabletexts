  <h1>Marie Henriksen</h1>
<div class="intro">
<p>I am a second-year student at Oxford Brookes Univeristy doing a BA in Media, Journalism and Publishing. I find both publishing and journalism very interesting, but I have a slightly bigger interest for Journalism because I have a passion for writing and would love to tell peoples' stories.</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Norway, more specifically, the north of Norway on the Lofoten islands. I absolutely love going for hikes, especially in the mountains we have right outside our door at home. I have three older brothers who all are married and have children. I am adventurous and I enjoy travelling and exploring the world. Because I have travelled a lot, I have friends spread across the globe. I live in Oxford right now, and I really like it here. I am however missing the nature at home. So, if Oxford was by the coast and had more mountains, it would be the perfect city for me.</p>

  <h2>My portfolio and website</h2>
  <p>Along with this blog about typography, I have made a website I use as my portfolio and also publish articles and other texts I have written. This is to give me practice in writing and actually sharing what I write. Check it out at <a class="blog" href="https://www.mariehenriksen.com">mariehenriksen.com</a></p>
