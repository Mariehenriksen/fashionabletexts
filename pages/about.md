#### **About me**

My name is Marie, and I am currently a second-year student at Oxford Brookes University studying Media Journalism and publishing.

#### **About this blog**

I am not a typical fashion girl, but I find the industry very interesting, which is why I have chosen it as the theme of this blog. More specific, I will look at the typography that represents the fashion world. This includes among others; fashion magazines, designer brands, and stores.

I have decided to present this blog in a simple and elegant way, using mostly black and white design. The typography I have decided to use myself is inspired by the fonts used in fashion. In my heading photo, I have used the same font they use on the cover of *Vogue.* Not only because it is featured on one of the world’s biggest fashion magazines, but because I personally really like it and I think it represents fashion. The serifs along with the mix of thick and thin lines, makes the typography look simple, but elegant. Also reflecting the saying ‘less is more’ which is often used in the fashion industry.Typography with serifs are frequently used in the fashion world, and I will in this blog take a look at why that is.

### My logo

When it comes to the logo, I have taken inspiration from several typographical fashion logos.

I have decided to keep my logo very simple with just two black letters representing “Fashionable Letters.” I have used the same typography as in my heading photo to keep the theme. While it may look like just two black letters placed beside each other, it is carefully thought through which you can see in the illustration below.
